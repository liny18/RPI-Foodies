I found this lab to be challenging because it has been a while since I touched html and css. Since intro to IT, I have learned a general overview about layouts like flexbox and grid, but I have not had much practise with them. Through working in one css file, I was able to review flexbox and grid layouts. I learned that I need to do more projects where I utilize my html and css skills especially the advance topic like flexbox.

When I started to build my personal page, I had visualized how it would look, but did not know how to start out with it. As I started later than my teammates, I had to look over their css in order to make sure my css does not create conflicts with theirs. Through this process, I was able to get hints on how to start, but it did not help much. I ended up using a list to format and center my code due to the time crunch. I really wanted to impliment advance concepts, but did not how to do it to be candid. I tried not to look anything up online as I wanted to figure it out by myself as I wont have time to relearn complex concepts during an exam.

Overall, I felt like I have improved as well. I was able to read my fellow teammates code and understand what they were trying to implement. I was able to recall most tags and attributes. Through this lab, I was able to improve my github skills and interact with my team members through creating branches and merging them together which I have struggled with in the past.

My site would work with browsers that dont support certain features like certain fonts. When I imported google fonts and set it as the font size, I also added another font as a "back up" for older browsers.

Overall, I know that I can become better at html and css. I just need to review and practise more. I hope to recreate my personal page once I get a better grasp of html and css.

Jordan Oberstein Readme


My resume in intro used a very different theme and layout that would make it stick out like a sore thumb on our group page. I stil wanted to use a somewhat dynamic layout which is why I used flexboxes to organize all of my information. I was partially inspired by Terry's resume and how the layout had clear separations. 

Overall this lab went pretty smoothly, I didn't feel myself getting stuck anywhere. This was a helpful review that helped get my mind back in the game, so to speak.

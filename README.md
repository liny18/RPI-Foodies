Welcome to RPI Foodies! Our website is a social media platform for RPI students to share and discover the food served in the dining halls. With RPI Foodies, students can easily access information about the food options on campus and make informed decisions about what to eat.

Our website features include:

Posting and viewing photos of the food served in the dining halls
Adding reviews and ratings of the food to help other students
Searching for specific dining halls or types of food
Categorizing posts by type of food (vegan/vegetarian, snacks, desserts, etc.)
Login and create account page for students to access their personal profile and posts
RPI Foodies is a valuable resource for all RPI students, especially first-year students and sophomores who are required to have a meal plan. It also benefits parents who want to know what their children are eating, and Sodexo and Rensselaer Dining who can use the data to improve their menus and services. Clubs and organizations can also use the platform to promote their events and free food.

Join RPI Foodies and never worry about risking a swipe on unappetizing food again!

This lab has given me a deeper understanding of Js than intro. First of all, I know how to get the id and class in the inner class, and I can understand the syntax of Js better when I learn how to use Js online. We also learned how to use JQuery again when we worked together to implement some animations. The biggest challenge for me in this Lab was definitely Js. Although I failed many times, I learned new knowledge from it.

I added custom fonts to the page,created some Js(but we decided to use other Js function instead) and button in html wrote all the annotations for the amendment, and helped debug it through GitHub.

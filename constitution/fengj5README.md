This lab has given me a deeper understanding of Js than intro. First of all, I know how to get the id and class in the inner class, and I can understand the syntax of Js better when I learn how to use Js online. We also learned how to use JQuery again when we worked together to implement some animations. The biggest challenge for me in this Lab was definitely Js. Although I failed many times, I learned new knowledge from it. I try to use online resource also i reached out with Dr. Callahan for help. I have done a pop up box for the webpage, but it still contain many bugs that i dont know how to debug. Then i changed to use JQeury to make the popup text box. Later, after our discussion, we changed our Js to collapsed text block as we seen in the final version. Even my js part is not used in the final version, but i still learned a lot while debugging these errors.

First, i participate in organize of the whole lab, and the basic desgin of the page. Also, I added custom fonts to the page,and button in html wrote all the annotations for the amendment, and helped debug through GitHub. I also helped to write the annotation of the amendment and find the picture associated with them.

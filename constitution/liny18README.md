For this project, I was responsible for making the hero section of our page. At first I didn't know what a hero section is until I looked at some sample websites. Then I learned about viewpoint and setting the size of the container to 1vh makes a hero section. Then I also implemented a background that sticks to the browser window. I did this by looking up background properties, which most I have never seen before. I also added our icon positioned-fixed at the top left corner as a navigation button to the top of the web page. I also helped formatting and styling the main content of our webpage, which was a lot of copy and paste. The biggest issue for me was implementing the JS code for hiding and showing objects. At first I was thinking of just hardcoding every content's id and call a function that takes in the content's id and toggle hide or display. But I knew there's for sure better ways to do this, so I did lots of googling, and with great help from a friend, I finished implementing the block of JS code that did exactly what I wanted; I learned lots of different properties in JS that I didn't before. In addition, our group also had disputes regarding job assignment, which we then later figured out that our mistake was not utilizing the Issues function on Github, and the price we had to pay was lost progress. We will be working on improving our communication for our group project.

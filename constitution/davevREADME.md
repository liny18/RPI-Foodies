I was responsible for creating the structure of the page. I used grid display to 
center the article, article description, and the button. Within these grid elements. 
I utilized flexbox to center the title and button and to align the paragraphs in the 
description. I used flex-direction: column for the description. In order to divide 
the articles, I added a border around each  article. I am proud of myself because I 
was able to utilize my grid and flexbox skills.

I did the html for the Constitution. I chose to use article tags to seperate it into a 
group of article and a group for the amendments. From there I used section tags
because I thought they would work best. Each article and amendment had its own section
and if there were sections in each, I gave them another section. I am proud of myself
because I have not used any divs.

I did the html for the Constitution. I chose to use article tags to seperate it into a 
group of article and a group for the amendments. From there I used section tags
because I thought they would work best. Each article and amendment had its own section
and if there were sections in each, I gave them another section. I am proud of myself
because I have not used any divs. That did infact change after we added css to our 
website, but it was nice while it lasted. It is interesting tho because now I am
actively tring to find ways to not use divs as compared to other times when I didn't
really care.
I also wrote out all the annotations for the articles and their sections. This was a 
pain, but I did learn some stuff I didn't know which was cool. Like I never knew you 
could assasinate a senator if you didn't like them then the gonverner of the state would
choose a new one. Cool stuff. 
I also did a ton of debugging this lab. I went through and changed all the misused tags
so that our validator would not throw warnings or errors. That wasn't fun, but it did 
need to get done so its ok.
I then worked on making collapsable buttons so that people could click through the 
Constitution. I used the reference on w3schools as my base. Its pretty annoying to implement
but would defenitly look cool. It did infact look cool.
I also played with screenreaders a little. It sounds funky because of the way it reads
the headers saying "Header 3" and the nav bar was weird, but it otherwise sounded ok.
In the future I want to test it out more because I think that making accessible websites
is a very important thing and one I haven't had a lot of practice in yet.

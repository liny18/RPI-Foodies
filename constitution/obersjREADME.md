Spent a lot of time working on a navbar
We later determined that the navbar is unnecessary. If our group had better communication, 
then I could have had time to work on other parts of our page. I and our group have learned
some valuable lessons and plan for better communication as we work on our project. 

I added and formatted the annoations on the main index page. 
I also took care of all the images for the annotations. 
I also fixed a handful of miscelaneous bugs and broken tags.

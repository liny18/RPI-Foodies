To start I put all my sources in the long list
for the main page read me. As for my own page I 
think my first main challenge, besides the obvious
of trying to remember what css and html can do, was
deciding how I wanted my page to look. I started by 
trying to code out how I wanted it but I wasn't really
making progress so I switched to drawing it out and then
adding each part piece by piece. That definetly helped
in the long run.

My next big challenge was trying to get my jobs and 
education to work. I wanted the info to be on one side 
and the logo of the company/school on the other. FIND

Lastly my last big issue was getting the margins to have 
color. Honestly I was lost for this one because I thought
that the padding would still be colored with the background
but for some reason it wasn't working like that.

Overall I spent a lot of time on this, but I think that 
as much as I suffered it was a good refresher on basic web 
design. I am not always a fan of front end, probably cause 
css can be such a pain, but I did really like designing the colors.
While they didn't make the cut, I did explore with gradients and 
did make some cool backgrounds with them. 

I did remember that I think I am more of a backend person then 
a frontend person. But its always good to learn both so I 
won't complain too much.

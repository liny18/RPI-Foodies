This lab is a new challenge for me because I hadn't continued to learn html and css since intro to it, 
so I was a little overwhelmed at first. My teammates were very helpful, they answered many of  
my questions, and because we shared a CSS file, I was learning while reading their CSS file, which was 
especially helpful in bringing back the memories of learning html and css.

My personal page was very difficult to develop at the beginning, I couldn't handle my personal photos 
in a beautiful way at first, this problem made me headache for a long time, after 
reading W3 School's tutorials, I finally finished a relatively compatible and aesthetic solution, 
and by learning the content of hcard mircoformat I was able to standardize my id and class names.

I believe the biggest headache was the CSS this time, because we all had to use the same CSS file 
and I started late, so I needed to spend some time to understand my teammates' finished CSS to make 
sure I didn't mess up the existing template. I also had to use some of the classes we created in the index
page to make sure it was the same theme, which challenging my understanding of the CSS and using it wisely. 
It took me quite a long time.

Also, this lab really help me with using of github and made me start using it, since I used to only upload full 
folders from the web side and not connect to VS Code to use it. Although I still had a lot of problems 
with Merging, they were all solved in my discussions with my teammates.

Overall, this lab has taught me a lot and given me a strong motivation to continue learning.

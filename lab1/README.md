# ITWS2110-F22-ErrorCats

To start we decided what kind of website style we
liked best. We ended up going with a more minimalistic
style. After that we made a few mock up, but ended up 
going with a different idea once we started coding. 
Most of the initial pains were trying to get back into
the swing of doing web design and one thing that troubled
us was splitting up the work. It is much more difficult we
realized to work on a project of this size and split the 
work up evenly. It helped us realize though that by 
directing a task to each person, specifically for the 
final project, we could work together much more efficiently
since we won't be clashing with each other about what we
are working on ie. we won't all be trying to do css.
